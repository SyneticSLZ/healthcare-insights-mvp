"The Medicare-Medicaid Linked Enrollee Analytic Data Source (MMLEADS) Version 2.0 Public Use File (PUF) contain demographic, enrollment, condition prevalence, utilization, and spending at the state level for calendar years 2006 through 2012.  The variables within each category are listed below.  Note that values (cells) where the count of beneficiaries was < 11 have been suppressed in accordance with CMS regulations (denoted by * in the cell).  If only one cell is suppressed for a measure, the second lowest cell is also suppressed to prevent re-identification.  When a variable is not applicable, this is denoted by a period (.) in the cell to indicate a missing value.

A MMLEADS PUF methodological overview is available.  This document describes the sample and methodology used to calculate all variables in the file.

When calculating the chronic condition and chronic and other potentially disabling condition prevalence for the Full Benefit and Partial Benefit enrollees, all Medicare and Medicaid Fee-for-Service claims are examined.  ",
