"NOTE: The National Health Expenditures price index is available for 2003 through 2023 only. Chain-weighted price indexes are used to deflate National Health Expenditures, Personal Health Care, Other Health, Residential, and Personal Care Services, Government Administration, Net Cost of Insurance, Government Public Health, Research, and Structures and Equipment. All other categories are deflated using fixed-weighted price indexes. Because aggregate categories are deflated using chain-weighted price indexes, the sum of real spending for the deflated categories will not equal the published totals for Personal Health Care and National Health Expenditures.
